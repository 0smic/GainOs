# GainOs

Gainos is open source operating system. It's more like a game. When you boot the os you have two options first one is run Offline second is run Online.

Run Offline is more like a advanced Linux operating system were you can do the normal things.

Run online basically mean it will connect to the Gain os server. You can be anonymous or show your identity. If you need to participate in the game you must register in the gainos.org website (which is not online yet).
Once you registered in the website. We will assign you a random username and password. This username and password is used to login to the game server. 

## About Game

Once you click Run Online a login section will pop up. You need to login with the username and password we assigned for you. Once you logged in. That mean you are connected to the server. You can use all your skill to gain access to the server. This server is not password protected. We don't want you to waste month trying to Brute-force it. 
Once we make the server online it will be vulnerable. An intermediate hacker or developer can easily gain access the server. Person who have access we call him/her King. The King want to maintain the access. If another hacker or Developer gain access to the server and remove the access of the current King. Then He/Her will be the New King.

To maintain as King you need to use all your skills to secure the server. You can modify the necessary files and so on.


## Chat Server

Once you choose Online mode. You also have a chat server in it. You can work as a team to secure the Server or you can gather knowledge and so on. There is no limitations. You can be anonymous or you can reveal your identity.

##### Things get you banned

- Using cryptography or password to secure the server for maintaining as King.
- Deleting system files (once we recognize it, we will reboot the server to original)

### Important

- We keep log details about the process you done to the Game Server to maintain as King.
- Your chat log or other log details other than connected to the game will not be saved.
- chat server is unfiltered so use it on your own risk.

People who think securing the server without any encryption or password is impossible They just don't know anything about the true value of programming..

This is a non-profitable organizations. We are contributing this to the community To find the King.

GainOs is Future Project.
